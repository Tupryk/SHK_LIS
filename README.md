### Ongoing SHK Projects at LIS Lab, TU Berlin

Within the Learning and Intelligent Systems (LIS) lab at TU Berlin, multiple projects are currently underway, driven by the diligent efforts of our Student Research Assistants. These projects encompass diverse areas within the realm of robotics:

- Randomized Robot Object Manipulation
- Development of an Omnidirectional Base for the Franka Robotic Arm
- Implementation of Robot Teleoperation using HTC Vive Controllers

Each project represents a distinct focus area, contributing to the exploration and advancement of robotics. These endeavors aim to enhance understanding and innovation in the field, addressing challenges such as randomized manipulation of objects by robots, augmenting the maneuverability of the Franka robotic arm through an omnidirectional base, and enabling intuitive control of robots using HTC Vive controllers.
