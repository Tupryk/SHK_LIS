To push:
- Removed import random as it is not used
- Fixed undefined variable in grasp_box

Suggestions:
- Gripper should have a default value (Maybe even be a class variable althougt this could be weird for two robots)
- Add typing
- Change grasp_top_box function name
- Helpers should be defined automatically
- Solve the self.rrt thing
