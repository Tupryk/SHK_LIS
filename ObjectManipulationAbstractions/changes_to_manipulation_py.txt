To push:
- Removed import random as it is not used
- Fixed undefined variable in grasp_box
- Add accumulated colisions for setup_point_to_point_motion
- Give a list of possible orientations. The solver chooses which ever one is possible (Instead the user has to do it manually)
- Implement manipulation for point clouds
- Solve the self.rrt thing

Suggestions:
- Gripper should have a default value (Maybe even be a class variable althougt this could be weird for two robots)
- Add typing
- Change grasp_top_box function name
- Helpers should be defined automatically, otherwise the user needs to know which function needs what helpers. Also helpers is kind of vague.
- Change setup_pick_and_place_waypoints to setup_pick_and_place_problem/setup_pick_and_place_motion. What does addModeSwitch do?
- Could it be more abstract? Instead of all the pick place functions just move object to
- The orientations should be a bit more clear
