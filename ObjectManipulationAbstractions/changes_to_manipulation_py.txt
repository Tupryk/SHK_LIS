Main changes:
- Fix undefined variable in grasp_box
- Add accumulated collisions for setup_point_to_point_motion (It is a function parameter that does not get used)
- Remove import random as it is not used
- Solve the rrt thing

Other ideas:
- Give a list of possible orientations instead of a specific one. The solver chooses which ever one is feasible/best
- Implement manipulation for point clouds
- Gripper frame ("l_gripper") input should have a default value (Maybe even be a class variable althougt this could be weird for two robots)
- Change grasp_top_box function name
- Helpers should be defined automatically, otherwise the user needs to know which function needs what helpers. Also helpers is kind of vague.
- Change setup_pick_and_place_waypoints to setup_pick_and_place_problem/setup_pick_and_place_motion
- Could it be more abstract? Instead of all the pick place functions just move object to
- Add typing
