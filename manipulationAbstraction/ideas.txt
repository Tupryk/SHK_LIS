- Make it a bit more clear when and why you need helpers in __init__
- Rename no_collision to keep distance, since "accumulatedCollisions" already makes sure that there are no collisions
- Make it so that komo chooses the optimal grasp position (Is this possible??)
- Change setup_pick_and_place_waypoints to something like setup_double_inverse_kinematics_waypoints
- Why the helpers in setup_point_to_point_motion
