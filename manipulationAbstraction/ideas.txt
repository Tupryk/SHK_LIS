- Make it a bit more clear when and why you need helpers in __init__
- Make it so that komo chooses the optimal grasp position (Is this possible??)
- Change setup_pick_and_place_waypoints to something more general
- Why the helpers in setup_point_to_point_motion
- Should we add setup_multi_phase_komo?
- Rename no_collision to keep distance, since "accumulatedCollisions" already makes sure that there are no collisions
- manipulation.py is getting really big, should we sepparate it into different modules? How big should it get?
- Should we write documentation for it to get a better grasp on what we want?
- Taking rotation into account when pushing. Attah joint between box and gripper?
